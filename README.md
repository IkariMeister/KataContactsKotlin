KataContacts written in Kotlin
==============================

Kata based on the repository created by [Karumi](https://github.com/Karumi/KataContactsJava)

These are the rules for the Kata:

- We are here to practice Clean Architecture Development.
- Clean Architecture is a way of structuring code.
- We are going to practice pair programming.

---

## Product requirements - Contacts App

- I want to be able to list my contacts.
- I want to be able to add a contact.

---

## Development platform

 - UI will be the command line.
 - All data is local.
 - The data origin will change in the future to consume a remote API.
 - There is no persistence between execution.

---

This Kata was first developed by the [Karumi Team](https://github.com/Karumi):

- [Java](https://github.com/Karumi/KataContactsJava)
- [Swift](https://github.com/Karumi/KataContactsSwift)
